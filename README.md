Project 1: Optimizing Solar Cooking Efficiency
•	Problem:

Many communities in rural areas rely on wood for cooking, which leads to deforestation, health hazards from smoke, and time lost gathering firewood. This project aims to develop a solar-powered cooking solution that replaces wood with a clean and renewable energy source.
Hypothesis:

By utilizing solar energy capture  and optimizing heat transfer methods, we can create a cost-effective, sustainable cooking system that achieves sufficient cooking temperatures without needing fossil fuels or electricity .


•	Solution:

I designed and tested various materials and setups to maximize the efficiency of solar heat capture and transfer to a cooking surface on regions. This project used real-world data and simulation models to assess the most effective designs based on solar radiation .


•	Code Breakdown:

Using Python and matplotlib for data analysis, I processed solar energy input, tested different cooking surface materials, and simulated heat transfer efficiency.


•	Data Sets & Models:

I gathered temperature data, solar radiation data, and material heat absorption data to model the performance. I used regression models and simulations to optimize performance across different environmental conditions.


•	Predictions & Conclusion:

After simulations and real-world testing, I concluded that a solar cooking system can reduce wood consumption by 80% in targeted regions. The most efficient design used reflective surfaces and heat-absorbing materials to maintain consistent cooking temperatures.
